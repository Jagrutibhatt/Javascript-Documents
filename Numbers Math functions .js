 *  Numbers and Mathematics in JavaScript
JavaScript provides various properties and methods to deal with Numbers and Maths. Let us have a quick look at those:

Numbers Properties:
MAX VALUE — The maximum numeric value that JavaScript can represent.
NaN — The "Not-a-Number" value is NaN.
NEGATIVE INFINITY – The value of Infinity is negative.
POSITIVE INFINITY – Infinity value that is positive.
MIN VALUE — The smallest positive numeric value that JavaScript can represent.
Numbers Methods:
toString() — Returns a string representation of an integer.
toFixed() — Returns a number's string with a specified number of decimals.
toPrecision() — Converts a number to a string of a specified length.
valueOf() — Returns a number in its original form.
toExponential() — Returns a rounded number written in exponential notation as a string.
Maths Properties:
E — Euler's number is E.
SQRT1_2 — 1/2 square root
SQRT2 stands for square root of two.
LOG2E — E's base 2 logarithm
LN2 — The natural logarithm of 2 is LN2.
LN10 — The natural logarithm of ten is LN10.
LOG10E — E's base ten logarithm
PI — PI stands for Pianistic Integer.
Maths Methods:
exp(x) — Ex's value
floor(x) — x's value rounded to the nearest integer.
log(x) — The natural logarithm (base E) of x is log(x).
abs(x) — Returns the value of x in its absolute (positive) form.
acos(x) — In radians, the arccosine of x.
asin(x) — In radians, the arcsine of x.
pow(x,y) — x to the power of y
random() — Returns a number between 0 and 1 at random.
round(x) — Rounds the value of x to the nearest integer.
sin(x) — The sine of x is sin(x) (x is in radians)
sqrt(x) — x's square root
tan(x) — The angle's tangent
atan(x) is the numeric value of the arctangent of x.
atan2(y,x) — Arctangent of its arguments' quotient
ceil(x) — x's value rounded to the next integer
cos(x) – The cosine of x is cos(x) (x is in radians)
max(x,y,z,...,n) — Returns the highest-valued number.
min(x,y,z,...,n) — The number with the lowest value is the same as the number with the highest value
